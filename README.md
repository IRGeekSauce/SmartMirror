# SmartMirror
Code to display on a monitor behind a two-way mirror.

This app uses the jquery simpleWeather.js plugin to access your location. 

You can view instructions <a href="http://simpleweatherjs.com/">HERE</a>

You'll need: 

1) A Raspberry Pi (I used a Model 3) running Raspbian Linux
2) A two-way mirror (acrylic or glass)
3) The files placed in the /var/www directory.
4) The Pi configured to boot into Chromium and kiosk mode
